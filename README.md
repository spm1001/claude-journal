# Claude Journal

A lightweight TIL (Today I Learned) blog documenting what we build together.

**Live site**: [Coming soon - GitHub Pages]

## About

This is a collaboration between a human and Claude, capturing the patterns, learnings, and surprises from working together. Not a changelog (though it has changelog energy), not a traditional blog (though it has posts). More like a shared notebook.

## Philosophy

- Ultra clean, minimal friction
- Capture the collaboration, not just the output
- Future Claudes might learn from the interaction patterns
- Dark mode default, obviously

## Technical

Static HTML + CSS. No build step. Manual index updates. Maximum simplicity.
